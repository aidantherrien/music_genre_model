# === Last.fm Artist Song Fetcher ===
# This script fetches top tracks for a list of artists grouped by genre using the Last.fm API.
# It then stores metadata about the fetched songs (title, artist, genre) in a CSV file, 
# which will later be used for tasks like audio downloading and dataset creation.
#
# === Dependencies ===
# - requests: for making HTTP requests to the Last.fm API
# - json: for loading the genre-artist mapping and processing API responses
# - csv: for writing the song metadata to a CSV file
# - random: for selecting a random set of top songs for each artist
# - os: for checking file paths and directory existence
#
# === Configuration ===
# API_KEY: Your Last.fm API key (replace with your own)
# ARTIST_JSON_PATH: Path to the JSON file containing artists grouped by genre
# OUTPUT_CSV_PATH: Path to the CSV file where song metadata will be saved
# X_SONGS_PER_ARTIST: Number of songs to fetch per artist
# Y_TOP_SONG_POOL: Number of top tracks to fetch for each artist from Last.fm
#
# === Functions ===
# - fetch_top_tracks: Fetches the top tracks for a given artist from the Last.fm API.
# - main: The main function that loads the genre-artist mapping, fetches songs for each artist,
#         and writes the song metadata to the CSV file.
#
# === Usage ===
# Run this script to fetch the top tracks for each artist, group them by genre, 
# and save the results to a CSV file for further processing.
